# Node.js Meme Scraper

A meme scraper, that scrapes the first ten memes of a webside
and saves the first 10 images into a folder called "memes" within the directory of the new project.
The image files should be named with a number with a leading zero, eg. 01.jpg, 02.jpg, etc.

TODO

- [ ] scraped memes shouldn't show up in git, use gitignore
- [ ] install Axios and Cheerio
- [ ] the images should be saved with a leading zero, e.g. 01.jpg
